# Prisma Production Fix

This document explains the changes made to fix the Prisma production deployment issue.

## Problem

The error occurred because Prisma couldn't locate the query engine for the `rhel-openssl-3.0.x` runtime in production:

```
PrismaClientInitializationError: Prisma Client could not locate the Query Engine for runtime "rhel-openssl-3.0.x"
```

## Solution

1. **Added multiple binary targets** in `prisma/schema.prisma`:
   ```prisma
   binaryTargets = ["native", "rhel-openssl-3.0.x", "linux-musl-openssl-3.0.x"]
   ```

2. **Improved Prisma client initialization** in `lib/prisma.ts` with better error handling.

3. **Updated Next.js configuration** in `next.config.mjs` to properly handle Prisma externals:
   ```javascript
   webpack: (config) => {
     config.externals.push('@prisma/client', '.prisma/client')
     return config
   }
   ```

4. **Created a dedicated production verification action** that:
   - Uses a locally instantiated Prisma client
   - Has better error handling for Prisma-specific errors
   - Properly disconnects the client after use
   - Provides user-friendly error messages

5. **Added postinstall script** to ensure Prisma client is generated after every install.

## Testing

To test these changes:

1. Run `pnpm dlx prisma generate` to generate the client with multiple binary targets
2. Deploy to Vercel or production environment
3. Verify that the waiting list verification works correctly

## Additional Notes

- The new verification action (`verify-waiting-list-production.ts`) is used specifically for production environments
- Error messages have been improved to be more user-friendly
- Added proper cleanup of Prisma connections to prevent memory leaks
